## Issue Tracker Methodology & Use

Our issue tracker will be organized and managed using Trello, a collaborative project management tool that allows for effective tracking and resolution of project-related issues. The Trello board will be structured with four primary lists: "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done." This setup will help us categorize and manage the status of each issue as it progresses through the different stages of resolution.

Each issue identified during the QA process will be logged as a separate card in the "To Do" list. These cards will include a detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, expected and actual behaviors, relevant attachments such as screenshots or videos, labels to categorize the issue (e.g., "UI Bug," "Performance Issue," "Browser Compatibility"), and an assignee responsible for addressing the issue. Additionally, due dates will be set to ensure timely resolution.

As team members work on resolving issues, they will move the corresponding cards from "To Do" to "In Progress." This signifies that the issue is currently being addressed. Once the issue has been fixed, the card will be moved to the "Review" list for verification. The QA team leader will review the fix to ensure that the issue has been resolved satisfactorily. If the fix is verified, the card will be moved to the "Done" list, indicating that the issue has been successfully resolved. If further adjustments are needed, the card will be moved back to "In Progress" with comments for additional work.

This structured approach to issue tracking ensures clear communication and accountability within the team. By using Trello, we can easily monitor the status of each issue, prioritize tasks, and ensure that all team members are aware of their responsibilities. Regular check-ins and updates on the Trello board will help us stay on track and maintain a high level of quality throughout the development process.
